"""Per-source OAuth configuration registry.

Most MCP servers advertise dynamic client registration (DCR), so lik-ui self-registers a
client at runtime and needs no entry here. This registry carries a pre-configured client
ONLY for sources whose authorization server has no DCR — today those are lik-mcp and
Google Drive (both fronted by Google as the AS) and GitHub, none of which expose a
registration endpoint. Adding a DCR-capable source later needs no entry; adding a
no-DCR source needs one.
