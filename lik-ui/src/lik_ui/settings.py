"""Configuration for lik-ui. Everything is driven by ``LIK_UI_``-prefixed environment
variables through a single pydantic ``Settings`` object, mirroring lik-mcp's convention:
swapping test for a real deployment is a credentials change here, not a code change.

Secrets (client secrets, session key, API key) live only in the environment and are
never logged. See ``settings.require_production_config`` for the fail-closed guard that
refuses to start a real deployment with auth/vault config missing.
