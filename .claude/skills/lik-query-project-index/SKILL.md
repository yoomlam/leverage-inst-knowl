description: Answer questions about Nava's projects using the Discovery Layer Catalog in Postgres (the lik-mcp service) and the project-index pages it points to. Use whenever someone asks about past work, project capabilities, agencies Nava has worked with, technologies used, or anything answerable from vetted project-index pages. Triggers on questions like "what has Nava done with X?", "find projects related to Y", "which projects involve Z agency", "tell me about the <name> project". Do NOT use for HR/policy questions or general web research.

# Query Project Index

Answers a project question from the **Catalog** (the lik-mcp service over Postgres), following
its pointers to the project-index pages in Confluence. It escalates through three levels and
**asks the user before widening scope** at each step, so the Catalog stays the primary path and
a broad Confluence search is only a last resort.

It also surfaces and accumulates **confirmation signals**: it shows how vouched-for each cited
source is (`read_confirmations`) and offers to record the user's confirmation (`confirm_source`).

## Prerequisites

- The **lik-mcp** MCP service is connected (pointed at `likdb_local` for manual testing) and the
  Catalog has been populated by the `lik-sync-catalog-from-project-indexes` skill.
- The Atlassian (Confluence) MCP tools are available (for reading pages and the Level 3 fallback).

Use the text the user passes to this skill as their question.

## Errors

If any tool call fails or a required tool is unavailable, **stop immediately**. Do not fall
through to the next level. Present:
1. The error or missing tool name
2. Likely root causes (e.g. server not running, tool not yet deployed, MCP session stale)
3. Remedies (e.g. restart the server, reconnect MCP, redeploy)

## Level 1 — exact Catalog lookup, then fuzzy lookup

If the question names a specific project, derive `subject = "project: <name>"` and call
`lookup_catalog_entry` with `entry_type = "index"` and that `subject`.

- **Hit:** follow the row — `getConfluencePage` at its `locator` (page ID) or `location` (URL) —
  read the page, and answer from it. Go to **Rank & present**.
- **Miss**, or the question doesn't name a single project exactly: call
  `search_catalog_entries` with `entry_type = "index"` and the question's key terms as
  `query`. This catches partial names, typos, and reordered words.
  - **Candidate hit(s):** follow the top candidate's pointer (`getConfluencePage` at its
    `locator`/`location`), read the page, and answer. Go to **Rank & present**.
  - **No candidates:** go to **Level 2 (ask first)**.

`search_catalog_entries` is a **targeted, bounded keyed lookup** — top-N ranked candidates,
not a full read — so it runs **without** the "ask before widening" prompt that Levels 2 and 3
require. It stays part of the primary Catalog path.

## Level 2 — list and scan (ask the user first)

On a Level 1 miss, **pause and ask the user** (let them pick a single letter):

> No exact Catalog match. How should I widen the search?
> **(a)** List all project-index entries from the Catalog and scan them, or
> **(b)** Skip to a Confluence search over project-index pages.

If **(a)**: call `list_catalog_entries` with `entry_type = "index"`. Scan the returned rows
(match the question's terms against each `subject` and `category`), pick the most relevant ones,
`getConfluencePage` their pointers, and answer. Then go to **Rank & present**.

If the scan finds nothing relevant, ask again before Level 3. If **(b)**: go to **Level 3**.

## Level 3 — Confluence fallback (ask the user first)

Only with the user's go-ahead, call `searchConfluenceUsingCql` with:
- cloudId: `navasage.atlassian.net`
- cql: `label = "project-index" AND text ~ "<key terms>"`

Read the top matches and answer, noting that this answer came from a **bounded Confluence search**,
not the Catalog. Then go to **Rank & present**.

A Catalog miss or a broken pointer is never an error — it's a cache miss that degrades to the next
level.

## Rank & present (every level)

For each page you're about to cite, build a citation:
- `store_kind`: `"confluence"`
- `location`: the page URL
- `locator`: the page ID
- `source_state`: the live page's content-state marker — the **SHA-256 hex digest of its
  markdown body** (from the `getConfluencePage` you already ran to read the page). Compute it
  exactly as the marker recipe below specifies.

**Content-state marker recipe (shared with `lik-sync-catalog-from-project-indexes`).** Take the
`body` field **verbatim** from `getConfluencePage(pageId, contentFormat: "markdown")`, write it
to a file (no added trailing newline, no normalization), and hash it: `shasum -a 256 FILE | cut
-d' ' -f1` (or `sha256sum FILE | cut -d' ' -f1`). The sync skill stores `source_state` this
identical way, so a live marker matches the stored one whenever content is unchanged. The
Confluence connector exposes no stable native signal (no version number; `lastModified` is only
a relative string like `"about 5 hours ago"`), so a body hash is the only reliable marker — see
[../../../limitations.md](../../../limitations.md).

**Response integrity guard (required).** The Confluence MCP connector can return the **wrong
page** when `getConfluencePage` / `searchConfluenceUsingCql` calls run concurrently — a response
silently carries another in-flight request's body, with no error (see
[../../../limitations.md](../../../limitations.md)). Hashing a mismatched body yields a
`source_state` for the wrong page, so confirmations and `edited_since` checks compare against the
wrong content. Before you hash or cite any page, assert the returned object's `id` equals the
`pageId` you requested (and that each CQL result belongs to the query you sent); on mismatch,
re-issue that single call serially until the `id` matches. Parallel fetches are fine as long as
each response passes this check first.

Call `read_confirmations` with that citation **and** `current_source_state` set to the same live
body hash. It returns one row per user who confirmed the source, each carrying:
- `confirmed_by`, and
- `edited_since` — `true` if that user vouched for content that has since changed (their stored
  marker ≠ the live marker), `false` if their confirmation still matches the live content.

Rank sources with `edited_since = false` confirmations weighed more heavily than `edited_since =
true` ones, and present the answer with each citation annotated, e.g. *"(3 confirmations, 1 on a
since-edited version)"*.

## Confirm (after answering)

Offer: *"Provide positive feedback for future queries by confirming any of these sources as correct and useful? Reply with the source number."* On a pick, call
`confirm_source` with the **same citation** (the live body hash as `source_state`), passing
the user's email as the token so `confirmed_by` is the real person, not the service account.
Re-confirming a source updates the user's stored marker to the current content. Report the result:
- `recorded` — confirmation saved (or updated, if they had confirmed an earlier version).
- `rejected` — the citation didn't resolve; say so and don't retry.

## Notes

- Compute the body-hash `source_state` once per page within a run and reuse it for both the
  `current_source_state` you read with and the citation you confirm with, so they line up.
- This skill is self-contained — it does not fetch instructions from Confluence.
- Reads are open; writes (confirmations) are attributed to the verified caller.
