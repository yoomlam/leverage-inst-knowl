name: lik-query-project-index
description: Answer questions about Nava's projects using the Discovery Layer Catalog (the lik-mcp service) and the project-index pages it points to. Covers, per project: scope and summary, impact and outcomes, client and agency details, client satisfaction and CPARS ratings, workstreams, capabilities and competencies, tech stack and technologies, tools/templates/frameworks, best practices, team roster (who worked on it), internal and shareable artifacts and deliverables, research findings, annual reports, external comms (blogs/decks), published case studies, and business-development assets. Use whenever someone asks about Nava's past or current work, or about a specific project's people, technology, delivery approach, results, or client. Triggers on questions like "what has Nava done with X?", "find projects related to Y", "which projects involve Z agency", "what tech stack did <project> use?", "who worked on <project>?", "how satisfied was the client on <project>?", "tell me about the <name> project". Do NOT use for HR/policy questions or general web research.

# Query Project Index

Answer a project question from the **Catalog** (the lik-mcp service), following its pointers to project-index pages in
Confluence. Also surface and accumulate **confirmation signals** per cited source (`read_confirmations` /
`confirm_source`).

Two widening modes:
- **Retrieval miss** (no project located) → escalate Levels 1→3, **asking before each widening**, so the Catalog stays
  primary and a broad Confluence search is the last resort.
- **Content gap** (project located, but its page lacks the asked-for detail) → check the project's own pages
  automatically, then **ask before widening further** — see **Content gap**.

The text passed to this skill is the user's question.

## Errors

If any tool call fails or a required tool is unavailable, **stop** — do not fall through to the next level. Present: (1)
the error / missing tool name; (2) likely causes (server down, tool not deployed, stale MCP session); (3) remedies
(restart server, reconnect MCP, redeploy).

## Level 1 — Catalog lookup (exact, then fuzzy)

Named project → derive `subject = "project: <name>"` and call `lookup_catalog_entry` (`entry_type="index"`, that
`subject`).

- **Hit:** `getConfluencePage` at the row's `locator` (page ID) or `location` (URL), read, answer → **Rank & present**.
  If the page resolves but lacks the asked-for detail → **Content gap**.
- **Miss**, or the question doesn't name one project exactly: call `search_catalog_entries` (`entry_type="index"`,
  `query` = key terms) — catches partial names, typos, reordered words.
  - **Candidate(s):** follow the top candidate's `locator`/`location`, read, answer → **Rank & present**.
  - **None:** → **Level 2**.

`search_catalog_entries` is a bounded top-N keyed lookup (not a full read), so it runs **without** the
ask-before-widening prompt — it stays part of the primary Catalog path.

## Level 2 — list & scan (ask first)

On a Level 1 miss, ask (single-letter pick):

> No exact Catalog match. Widen how?
> **(a)** List all Catalog project-index entries and scan them, or
> **(b)** Skip to a Confluence search over project-index pages.

**(a):** `list_catalog_entries` (`entry_type="index"`); scan rows (match the question's terms against each `subject` and
`category`), pick the most relevant, `getConfluencePage` their pointers, answer → **Rank & present**. If nothing
relevant, ask again before Level 3. **(b):** → **Level 3**.

## Level 3 — Confluence fallback (ask first)

Only with the user's go-ahead, `searchConfluenceUsingCql`:
- cloudId: `navasage.atlassian.net`
- cql: `label = "project-index" AND text ~ "<key terms>"`

Read top matches, answer — note it came from a **bounded Confluence search**, not the Catalog → **Rank & present**.

A Catalog miss or broken pointer is never an error — it's a cache miss that degrades to the next level.

## Content gap — project found but its page doesn't answer

The index/Home page the Catalog points at is a **summary**; most detail lives on child pages in the same Confluence
space. A located page that lacks the asked-for detail — or whose relevant field/child page is a **placeholder** (e.g.
"TBD", "Coming Soon", "No … yet", a blank field) — is **not** an answer; treat it as a content gap. First search the
project's own space automatically; if that doesn't answer, **stop and ask the user** how to widen.

**Auto — the project's own space.** Nava project spaces share a standard page tree, so map the question to its likely
child page and read that page directly:

| Question is about… | Likely page |
|---|---|
| scope / summary / what the project is | `1.1 Project Scope` |
| impact, outcomes, results | `1.2 Project Impact` |
| client / agency | `1.3 Client Details` |
| client satisfaction, CPARS ratings | `1.4 Client Satisfaction Results` |
| workstreams | `1.5 Workstreams Overview` |
| capabilities, competencies | `2.1 Capabilities and Competencies` |
| tech stack, technologies | `2.2 Tech Stack / Technology` |
| tools, templates, frameworks | `2.3 Templates, Tools, Frameworks` |
| best practices, lessons | `2.4 Best Practices` |
| team, who worked on it, roster | `3.1 Team Roster` |
| artifacts, deliverables, sprint reports | `4.1 Artifacts (Internal)` / `4.2 Artifacts (Shareable)` |
| research, discovery findings | `4.3 Research Index` |
| annual reports | `4.4 Annual Reports` |
| blogs, decks, external comms | `5.1 External Comms` |
| case studies | `5.2 Published Case Studies` |
| BD / proposal assets | `5.3 BD Asset Index` |

Find it: `searchConfluenceUsingCql`, cloudId `navasage.atlassian.net`, cql
`space = "<space key>" AND title ~ "<mapped title>" AND type = page` (space key = the located page's `space.key`, or its
`location` URL, e.g. `/spaces/PITIR/` → `PITIR`). This tree is a **hint, not a guarantee** — thinner or newer projects
may omit pages. If the title map misses or returns nothing, fall back to a full-text scan of the space:
`space = "<space key>" AND type = page AND text ~ "<key terms>"`. Read the matches and answer, noting the detail came
from a child page, not the index.

**Still a gap → report and ask.** If the auto step finds no usable answer — no mapped page, or the page is
placeholder/empty — **report the gap to the user** and ask how to widen (single-letter pick). Offer the options the page
itself earns: alongside the always-available links and Confluence-search options, add one option **per external pointer
the page named** as where the detail actually lives, and **say what named it** so the offer is grounded, not invented:

> The project's index doesn't capture that — its `<page>` is empty/placeholder. Widen how?
> **(a)** Follow the most likely links I found so far (the pages reference external docs/links), or
> **(b)** Run a Confluence-wide search on the key terms (beyond this project), or
> **(c)** Check `<system type>` `<the pointer the page named>` — *the `<page>` names it (e.g. it says "synced from
> Workday", or links a `program-review-…` channel)* — so the live detail likely lives there, or
> **(d)** Something else — tell me.

Include a **(c)**-style option only when the page genuinely names such a pointer — an external system it syncs from, a
chat channel, a linked tool/doc. **Name the pointer's system type** (e.g. "Slack channel", "Workday", "Google Doc",
"Jira board") — a bare name like `program-review-wa-ui` or "the channel" is ambiguous; the user must see *what kind of
thing* it is to judge the option. List one per distinct pointer; cite the exact in-page reference (a quoted phrase or
the link text) as the reason. This stays store-agnostic: don't assume any particular system exists — surface whatever
*this* page pointed at, labeled by its type. If acting on a pointer needs a tool you don't have (no connector for that
system), still offer it but note you'd need that access — or that the user may have to look there themselves.

Act on the pick. For **(a)**, fetch the specific linked pages/docs you already surfaced. For **(b)**,
`searchConfluenceUsingCql` on `text ~ "<key terms>"` with no `space`/`label` restriction; note the answer came from a
broad search, not the Catalog or this project. For a **(c)** pointer, follow it with whatever tool fits (e.g. fetch the
linked page, search the named channel); if no such tool is available, say so and stop rather than guessing.

Apply the **Response integrity guard** and **marker recipe** to every page read here, and cite each page drawn from in
**Rank & present**. If nothing surfaces the detail, say so plainly — it genuinely isn't captured.

## Rank & present (every level)

**Cite every page that contributed to the answer** — whichever level/method surfaced it (Level 1 hit or fuzzy candidate,
Level 2 scan pick, Level 3 search, Content-gap (a)/(b)) — each as its own **numbered** source. The numbered citations
are what the user votes on in **Feedback**, so an uncited page can never be confirmed or flagged. When in doubt, cite.

Each citation:
- `store_kind`: `"confluence"`
- `location`: the page URL
- `locator`: the page ID
- `source_state`: the live body hash (marker recipe below), from the `getConfluencePage` you already ran to read the
  page. Compute it once per page per run and reuse it for both the citation and the `current_source_state` you read
  confirmations with, so they line up.

**Marker recipe (shared with `lik-sync-catalog-from-project-indexes`).** Take the `body` field **verbatim** from
`getConfluencePage(pageId, contentFormat:"markdown")`, write it to a file (no added trailing newline, no normalization),
and hash: `shasum -a 256 FILE | cut -d' ' -f1` (or `sha256sum FILE | cut -d' ' -f1`). The sync skill stores
`source_state` this identical way, so a live marker equals the stored one whenever content is unchanged. The connector
exposes no stable native signal (no version number; `lastModified` is only a relative string like
`"about 5 hours ago"`), so the body hash is the only reliable marker — see
[../../../limitations.md](../../../limitations.md).

**Response integrity guard (required).** Concurrent `getConfluencePage` / `searchConfluenceUsingCql` calls can silently
return the **wrong page**'s body, with no error (see [../../../limitations.md](../../../limitations.md)) — hashing it
yields a `source_state` for the wrong page, corrupting confirmations and `edited_since`. Before you hash or cite any
page, assert the returned object's `id` equals the requested `pageId` (and that each CQL result belongs to the query you
sent); on mismatch, re-issue that single call serially until the `id` matches. Parallel fetches are fine as long as each
response passes this check first.

`read_confirmations` — pass the citation **and** `current_source_state` = the same live body hash. Returns one row per
voter:
- `confirmed_by`
- `vote` — `up` (source was right) / `down` (wrong)
- `reason` — for a down, `bad-retrieval` (poor/irrelevant) or `wrong-content` (factually wrong); `null` for an up
- `comment` — optional free-text note (mostly on `wrong-content` downs)
- `edited_since` — `true` if the voter's content has since changed (stored marker ≠ live), `false` if it still matches,
  `null` if unknown.

**Signed ranking:** ups boost, downs **soft-demote — never hide**. Rank a source lower when downs outweigh ups, but
still return it. Weight `edited_since=false` votes more heavily than `=true` ones (a vote on since-changed content —
including a wrong-content flag whose source was since corrected — counts only weakly). Annotate each cited source:
- positives, e.g. *"(3 confirmations, 1 on a since-edited version)"*;
- downs — **explain the demotion** with the reason kind and any `comment`, e.g. *"(demoted — flagged by 2: wrong content
  — 'states the 2019 rate, superseded in 2022')"*.

**Page-stated freshness.** If a cited page states its own currency in the body you already read — a "canonical as of
<date>" note, an "Update Frequency", or a "Verified <date>" stamp — surface it alongside the confirmation annotations,
so the user sees how current the page claims to be. Read from the body you already have; don't fetch extra pages for
this.

**Presenting sources.** Each source is a hyperlink on its title — the `location` URL is the href.
- **Don't show the page ID** (the `locator`). It's needed only to build the citation/tool calls, never in the displayed
  Source line.
- **Only annotate confirmations when there are any.** If `read_confirmations` returned rows, summarize them (the
  signed-ranking annotations above). If it returned none, **say nothing** — do not print "No prior confirmations" or
  equivalent.

## Feedback (after answering)

Offer least-typing feedback:

> *"Was a cited source right or wrong? Reply with its number to vouch it was right (e.g. `2`), or
> the number with a trailing `-` to flag it was wrong (e.g. `2-`)."*

A bare number (or trailing `+`) = **up**; a trailing `-` = **down**.

**On a down**, ask one pick — *bad retrieval* (poor/irrelevant) or *wrong content* (factually wrong):
- **bad retrieval** → record immediately (`vote="down"`, `reason="bad-retrieval"`).
- **wrong content** → ask *"What's wrong with it?"*, capture the reply as `comment` (`vote="down"`,
  `reason="wrong-content"`), **and** offer the correction path: help the user fix the source under their own login (e.g.
  edit the Confluence page). Logged regardless of whether they correct it.

Then `confirm_source` with the **same citation** (live body hash as `source_state`), the chosen
`vote`/`reason`/`comment`, and the user's email as the token (so `confirmed_by` is the real person, not the service
account). One current vote per source — re-voting replaces the prior vote and updates the voter's stored marker to
current content. Report:
- `recorded` — saved (or replaced).
- `rejected` — didn't go through (citation didn't resolve, or a down without a valid reason); say so and don't retry.
