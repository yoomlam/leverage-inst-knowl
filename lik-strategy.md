# Institutional Knowledge for AI Enablement — Implementation Strategy

**The problem.** Institutional knowledge is scattered across many systems. To answer a question, every AI agent, app, and person has to search all of them — repeatedly and redundantly. That is slow, token-expensive, inconsistent across tools, and prone to missing the trusted or current answer. We want that knowledge reliably discoverable and retrievable for AI agents and people alike — *without* creating a second source of truth or copying everything into one place.

**Key terms.**
- **Data Sources (DSs)** — the systems where knowledge is actually created, corrected, and governed: Google Drive, Confluence, Jira, GitHub, Slack, Gmail, Salesforce, Workday, etc. They remain the **source of truth**; all durable writes happen here.
- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) — the service interface through which agents and apps read and write DSs (and later DL) under a verified user identity.
- **Discovery Layer (DL)** — a lightweight, *computed* layer **derived from the DSs** (indexes, aggregations, freshness/confirmation signals, pointers) that makes discovery and retrieval faster. It is never a second source of truth, and most of it is recomputable from the DSs at any time. Its data is **distributed across many stores** — a summary in a Doc, signals in a Sheet, tables in a warehouse — wherever each output best belongs.
- **Catalog** — DL's "yellow pages": a single, **published, well-known location** (one address clients know in advance) mapping `type + subject → location`. Because DL is scattered, the catalog is **typically a client's first stop** — one lookup to find *where* any DL output lives, then follow the pointer, instead of searching every store.

Other acronyms used below:
- **ACL** (access control list) — the per-record permissions a system stores: who may read or write what.
- **SSO** (single sign-on) — one verified login across systems; here, **Google SSO** + **Google Groups** for role/permission grouping.
- **OIDC / OAuth** — the standard identity/authorization protocols that produce the verified token carrying the user's identity.
- **BI** (business intelligence) — operational dashboards and reporting (the Parallel Track).

**The strategy.** This is an implementation strategy for Leveraging Institutional Knowledge (LIK). It starts by *buying* (Layer 0) to learn what's actually missing, then *builds* progressively (Levels 1–3) only where a bought tool falls short — with a parallel data-pipeline track. Each level is independently useful, adds one capability, and is justified by a limitation in the level before it.

The strategy is deliberately falsifiable: ship a layer, learn from it, and only spend on the next if the prior one proved the need. Every layer ends with a **limitation** — the reason the next one exists.

---

## Layer 0 — Buy a commercial tool and learn

**Goal:** get immediate value and a measurable baseline by adopting an existing tool *before* building anything — and use the experience to decide what, if anything, is worth building.

Commercial enterprise-search / AI-retrieval products already connect to these DSs, enforce permissions, and provide AI retrieval out of the box. Buy one and run it for a few months:

- **Commercial apps** — Glean, GoSearch, SearchUnify.
- *Lower-cost variant:* self-hosted open-source platforms — Onyx CE, PipesHub, SWIRL — adopt (don't build) if data residency or budget rules out commercial apps.

**What we get beyond the tool itself:**
- A **working capability today**, with no build cost.
- A **baseline / yardstick** to measure any future build against — the honest comparison is "our build vs. this tool," not "our build vs. nothing."
- Most importantly, a **catalogued backlog of gaps**: specific **use cases**, each a `(data source, user question)` pair, where the bought tool does poorly — cross-source aggregations it can't compute, stale or untrusted answers, secured-but-discoverable content it can't reach, rankings it gets wrong. These gaps become the build backlog for the levels below.

**How to run it:** pick a pilot user group, connect a few high-value DSs, and have users log real questions and rate the answers. Track precisely *where* it fails — which data sources it can't reach, which questions come back wrong/stale/incomplete, which permissions it can't honor.

### Expected limitations of this layer

A turnkey tool is a black box — possible limitations include: you can't change its ranking, and you can't add cross-source aggregations or confirmation signals it doesn't natively support. Its **data-handling model** also matters and varies per tool — confirm it during evaluation, and wherever a data copy exists test third-party data-custody controls:

- *Index-based* (e.g., Glean, GoSearch) ingests/crawls sources into its own search index — a derived copy with source ACLs mirrored in, and a bulk re-export surface.
- *Federated / connector* (e.g., SearchUnify) queries sources at read time and doesn't persist a full copy.
- Many are *hybrid*.

The gaps catalogued here become the **build backlog** for Levels 1–3 — and if none are worth the cost, the strategy correctly stops at Layer 0.

---

## Level 1 — Direct DS access via MCP

**Goal:** address Layer 0's gaps by building our own agent that reads and writes institutional knowledge in the systems where it already lives, with access governed by Google SSO.

The **Data Sources (DSs)** — Google Drive, Confluence, Jira, GitHub, Slack, Gmail, Salesforce, Workday — stay the source of truth. Nothing is copied or pre-computed yet. Each DS is exposed through an **MCP service**, and the agent reads/writes through it.

### 1.1 Single agent, read-only

A local Claude Cowork-style agent connects to a few approved DSs via MCP and reads on the user's behalf.

- **Access control via Google SSO.** Each MCP service / AI connector requires a **verified Google OIDC/OAuth token** (audience-validated); the verified email *claim* authorizes the call. Identity is carried across every `agent → MCP → DS` hop (token passthrough / on-behalf-of), so the agent can only ever see what the signed-in person can see. An email is an identifier, never a self-asserted authenticator.
- **The DS enforces its own native permissions.** The connector authenticates to each DS as the signed-in user, and that DS applies its native ACLs directly — no separate enforcement layer to keep in sync, and no need to provision Google Groups for DL at this level. (Maintaining a Google Group that represents a shared output's audience — for sources not already group-based — only becomes necessary once DL produces shared outputs; see Level 2's access-control model.)

### 1.2 Read-write to DSs

The agent writes back under the **user's own SSO identity**, through each DS's normal permissions. The **write model** is deliberately narrow and stays fixed for all later levels:

- **New knowledge** → a DS (policy → Confluence/Drive; decision → ticket/page).
- **Corrections** → guide the user to fix the underlying record in its DS.
- **Human-verified summaries** → a DS.

Because access is enforced per-DS on every read and write, **new data inherits the right protections automatically** — a doc written into a restricted Drive folder is restricted; a ticket created in a private project stays private. No separate permission system to keep in sync.

### 1.3 Organization skills — encode *how* to answer

Even with read/write MCP access, a raw agent doesn't know the organization's retrieval conventions: which DS is authoritative for which question, what internal jargon to search for, which space holds the real answer. Capture that know-how once as a **skill** — a reusable set of instructions that guides the agent's behavior for certain question types — and share it as an **"organization skill" available to any employee**, so everyone's agent benefits from the same institutional know-how without each person rediscovering it.

A skill can direct the agent to, for example:

- **Query a particular DS first** for a given question type — e.g., policy questions → the Confluence policy space before anything else; HR/benefits → Workday; incident history → the Jira incident project and the `#incidents` Slack channel.
- **Search with specific terms** — expand internal acronyms and codenames (`PTO` → "paid time off"; project "Atlas" → its real ticket prefix), apply known synonyms, and prefer the org's canonical phrasing.
- **Scope the search** — restrict to certain folders, spaces, labels, or projects, and exclude known-noisy or deprecated locations.
- **Prefer authoritative sources** — name the documents/owners that are the source of truth for a topic, and rank them above ad-hoc mentions.
- **Follow a fallback chain** — if the primary DS yields nothing, try the next-best source in a defined order rather than fanning out blindly.
- **Shape the answer** — always cite source links, surface each source's last-updated date, and flag when the best match looks stale.
- **Route by entity** — map a team/client/project name to the systems and people that own it.

This is the cheapest, human-authored analog of what the Discovery Layer later automates: it encodes "where to look and how to ask" as shareable instructions instead of computed pointers. A skill is **maintained by a named owner**, **versioned**, and improved as the gap backlog from Layer 0 reveals where agents go wrong.

Crucially, a skill is **guidance, not enforcement** — which is exactly why it's safe to share with everyone: it can only help an agent *find* answers faster, never widen access. Every query still runs under the user's own SSO identity (§1.1), so the DS's permissions — not the skill — decide what comes back. This means organization skills need no approval regime or governed-writer controls; a bad or stale skill can misdirect (send someone to the wrong place), but it can never leak data the user wasn't already entitled to. The corollary: never rely on a skill to *restrict* access — gating is always the DS's job.

### Broadening the data consumers

The MCP-to-DS path is not specific to one agent. The same services can back other clients — including the **commercial or self-hosted tools from Layer 0**, repointed at our MCP services so they proxy the end-user's identity instead of relying solely on their own connectors (and, for index-based tools, their own copy of the data).

**Third-party trust boundary (inline hardening):** external tools are a distinct trust zone. For each one, define **credential scope** (least-privilege slice), **data minimization** (which DSs, not all), **retention/training constraints**, and **breach containment**. A tool querying under its own service credentials must faithfully proxy the end-user's identity so per-DS enforcement isn't bypassed.

### Expected limitations of this level

Where no skill covers a question, a tool must **query each DS and fan out across all of them** on every request — slow, token-expensive, inconsistent across tools, and prone to dead ends.

Organization skills (§1.3) cut that blind fan-out for the questions they cover, but they don't remove the underlying problem — they only point the agent at the right place. The **residual limitations** that survive even a good skill are what motivate Level 2:

- **No reuse of computed results.** A skill says *where* to look, but the agent still performs the full retrieval and synthesis **live on every query** — the same work repeated, never cached as a reusable output.
- **Hand-authored guidance doesn't scale or compute.** A skill can route by question type, but it can't carry per-subject pointers for thousands of projects/clients, and it can't **precompute** aggregations, freshness, or trust signals — it can only direct, not derive.
- **Skills drift.** They are manually maintained, so they go stale as DSs change; there is still no shared, *computed* view of what exists or where it is.

---

## Level 2 — Discovery Layer computed outputs (no catalog yet)

**Goal:** stop re-searching the DSs from scratch by precomputing reusable **Discovery Layer (DL)** outputs derived from them — automating and scaling what the §1.3 organization skill did by hand (hand-authored "where to look" → *computed* pointers and *precomputed* outputs any tool can reuse).

**The identity shift from Level 1.** Where Level 1 ran under the **user's** SSO (the agent saw only that user's slice, enforced per-DS automatically), DL outputs are produced by a **DL skill** on a schedule or on demand under its **own non-user service identity** — never the triggering user's SSO. It reads exactly what that identity is granted (data shared with the account, or DSs where it's in the right Google Group), scoped **least-privilege per DS**; admitted across many sources, it reads inputs no single user could see and computes one shared output for everyone. That power is also its hardening burden — it assigns each output a sharing group (below), **default-deny** so a miss over-restricts rather than leaks. *(Distinct from the §1.3 **organization skill**, shareable guidance that steers a user's agent at query time; the DL skill is the automated **producer**.)*

DL is **computed, never a second source of truth** — **AI-generated by default** (hand-authored artifacts are tagged `human-created`), mostly **recomputable** from the DSs, and tagged with whatever the store supports (provenance, freshness, classification, sharing group — no bespoke system). Each output is written to a **backing store** named in the skill's instructions: often a DS people already use (Doc, Confluence page, Sheet), or a dedicated non-DS store (Postgres, a BigQuery warehouse). The choice turns on *who consumes it* (people → human-readable artifact; tools → machine signals) and *how much write integrity it needs*. Access control is **uniform** across stores, described once next.

### Access control — share with a group, fail-closed

Every output the DL skill writes carries one of three sharing states:

1. **Shared with a specified Google Group** — the group that should see it.
2. **Explicitly unrestricted** — an affirmative flag the skill sets to open the output org-wide (the "cleared" case).
3. **Unspecified → default-deny** — shared only with a restricted fallback group, never open. Absence of a decision is never "open."

Enforcement is the **store's own native group/role grant** — there is no separate enforcement layer to keep in sync:

| Store | How a specified group is honored |
|---|---|
| **Google Drive / Docs / Sheets** | Native sharing to the Google Group — direct. |
| **Confluence** | Page/space restriction to a Confluence group **synced** from the Google Group (Atlassian Access / SCIM). |
| **BigQuery** | IAM grants the Google Group a role on the dataset/table; authorized views and row-access policies for finer control — direct. |
| **Postgres** | The one outlier: needs a `Google Group → Postgres role` bridge, or a fronting service that resolves the caller's groups into a row-level-security predicate. |

Because each output is *either* one specified group *or* explicitly unrestricted, the skill **never computes a most-restrictive intersection** — the mosaic problem disappears. Two disciplines keep it correct: **one sensitivity tier per output** (one group unambiguously matches the audience — e.g., *project-X summary → project-X members*; blending tiers is a smell, split it), and the author **names that group in the instructions** (the skill doesn't choose at runtime). Where a source isn't already group-based (Slack, Jira, Salesforce, Workday), an admin must **provision a Google Group** mirroring the audience, else the output stays default-deny. Sharing with a **live** group is a bonus — revocations propagate automatically (no per-user cache to go stale); the skill only re-runs when an output's correct group changes.

### 2.1 Human-readable artifacts

Summaries, digests, curated indexes → written into a DS people already use (a Doc, a Confluence page), shared per the model above and **provenance-marked `AI-generated`**. Read and write are both the DL skill's **service identity**, so the artifact is attributed to the skill, not a person — **unverified** until a person reviews it, then **`human-verified`** under that reviewer's identity. Version history supplies attribution, audit, and revert.

### 2.2 Machine retrieval signals

Indexes, prioritized pointers, retrieval hints, freshness/obsolescence signals are saved to a store chosen for scale (a Google Sheet at small scale; BigQuery or Postgres later). This is a storage-engine choice, not an architectural one; access control is the same group-share model above.

*Hardening (inline):* when a signal store outgrows a Sheet and moves to a **non-versioned** store (Postgres/warehouse), its writer runs under **governed-writer controls** — no long-lived keys (e.g., Workload Identity Federation), a rotation schedule, least privilege, and audit logging on all writes. Postgres additionally needs the `group → role` bridge from the table above.

### 2.3 Confirmation signals

Users can confirm that a **DL output** or a **DS data** an AI built its response from is trustworthy -- confirming the underlying source of truth feeds the ranking signals of §2.2. These confirmations **originate in DL** from user feedback and exist in **no DS** — they are **durable DL-origin data**, the one part of DL that is *not* recomputable. **Revert is their only recovery.**

**Linking a signal to its data.** A confirmation can only attach to specific data if the response is traceable to it — which the §1.3 "always cite source links" convention already guarantees; the citation is the join key. Each signal also records the **version of the confirmed data** as its own column (e.g., doc revision, ticket `updated_at`), so a later edit doesn't silently inherit trust the prior version earned.

**How a user confirms** — from explicit to implicit:
- **An affordance in the AI tool** — thumbs-up / "accurate," scoped per cited source rather than the whole answer (one response may cite several sources; only one was the good one).
- **Conversationally, to the agent** — in Claude Cowork there may be no button; the user just says "yes, that's right," and the agent records it by calling an **MCP confirm tool** (agent-native parity with the button).
- **A correction is a negative signal** — when a user fixes the underlying record (§1.2), capture that too; trust is two-sided.

Like all DL writes, a **service account writes the confirmation to the store** — users never get direct write access to the confirmation store. The **confirming user's verified identity is captured as an attributed field** (e.g., `confirmed_by`), and routing every write through the service lets it enforce validation, **rate-limiting / de-duplication** (so no one inflates a record's trust by confirming it repeatedly), and provenance at write time. Read access follows the group-share model above.

- **Start in a Google Sheet:** the service account writes to it; version history is the audit log, and revert recovers a bad write.
- **Promote** to a service-fronted store (e.g., Postgres + app) when scale, untrusted writers, or high-stakes ranking demand stronger write-time enforcement. Being non-recomputable, they need their own backup/retention.

### 2.4 Using confirmation signals at query time

The §2.3 table is just another §2.2 machine-retrieval signal: an **organization skill** (§1.3) triggered by a user's question can read it — joining on the DS-record or DL-output pointer the answer cites — and let accumulated trust shape the response. The skill runs under the **user's** SSO, so it only ever sees confirmations the group-share model already permits. How aggressively a skill leans on trust is the **skill author's choice**; the options below run from lightest-touch to most invasive.

- **A. Presentation only** (never changes what's retrieved) — annotate "confirmed accurate by N people" (or by a named expert, from `confirmed_by`), or flag "reported inaccurate on <date>" for a previously-corrected record. Safest; never hides data.
- **B. Version-aware** (exploits the confirmed-version column) — **staleness gating** (if the record changed since it was confirmed, downgrade/flag — "confirmed, but edited since") and **recency decay** (weight recent confirmations higher).
- **C. Ranking** (changes which data the answer uses) — **tie-breaker** (prefer the more-confirmed of similarly-relevant or conflicting candidates; least distorting), **rank boost** (relevance retrieves, trust reorders), or **threshold/filter** (aggressive — prefer soft demotion, since a hard filter can hide correct-but-unconfirmed data).
- **D. Audience weighting** (exploits `confirmed_by`) — weight confirmations from the asker's group or a topic's owners (§1.3) above a stranger's; adds query-time group-resolution cost.

**Choosing a strategy.** Start with **A + staleness gating (B)** — read-only, transparent, exploiting columns we already capture. Add the **tie-breaker (C)** once confirmation volume is trustworthy. Defer hard filters and audience weighting until the Layer 0 gap backlog shows a question type that needs them. Whatever the choice, **trust advises, never gates**: a record the user is entitled to is never hidden by low trust, only ranked or annotated — gating stays the DS's job (§1.3).

### Expected limitations of this level

DL now deliberately **spreads outputs across many stores** — a Doc here, a Sheet there. To use them, every tool must hard-code that storage topology, or fan out and search every store — reintroducing the Level 1 problem one layer up. There is **no single known place to start**.

---

## Level 3 — The catalog (a single Google Sheet)

**Goal:** give every consumer **one lookup** to discover where any DL output lives, decoupled from storage decisions.

The catalog is DL's "yellow pages": a directory you consult to find *where* an output lives (`entry_type + subject → location`), then follow the pointer. It indexes DL's **topology**, not DS content, so a subject's pointers can migrate from a Sheet to BigQuery by changing one catalog row — with no change to any agent.

It is the one artifact nothing points *to*, so it lives at a **well-known address** agents know a priori; everything else is discovered through it.

**Implemented as a single Google Sheet — chosen for transparency.** A Sheet gives native sharing, SSO-attributed edits, and version history *for free*, and anyone can open it and see exactly what the catalog claims. It is treated as **just another DS artifact**: any user with native edit access may write it, edits are attributed via SSO and logged by version history, and a bad edit is reverted. Suits low-cardinality pointers (dozens to low-hundreds of subjects). The schema is in [lik-architecture-concise.md §2](lik-architecture-concise.md).

**How it's created and kept honest.** The **DL skill**, writing under an ordinary non-human Google account (e.g., `summarizer@navapbc.com`), registers each computed output's location as it runs, appearing in version history like any editor. Because version history is *corrective, not preventive*, each run also **validates entries / dangling pointers and re-derives the rows it owns** (`row_provenance = 'skill'`), bounding any misdirection window; hand-authored rows it can't re-derive rely on revert.

*Hardening (inline):*
- **The catalog stores pointers, not permissions.** Real access is enforced at each target store's group grant (§2 access control), so a tampered or wrong catalog row can *misdirect* a lookup but can never *widen* access. This is why the Sheet can stay openly editable.
- **Promotion.** When subject count or pointer volume outgrows a Sheet, promote the *same logical schema* to **Postgres or any indexed DB** — consumers still do one `(entry_type, subject)` lookup. A catalog in a non-versioned store takes on the **governed-writer discipline** and adds its own audit columns (`created_at` / `updated_at` / `updated_by`), which the Sheet realization doesn't need.

**Result.** Tools have one known starting point instead of fanning out per query. This is the core of "data democracy": authorized users reach knowledge without knowing where any artifact physically lives.

**The organization skill now evolves.** What §1.3 did by hand — a maintained routing table of "for this question, look here" — the catalog now provides as computed, scalable data. So the skill stops hard-coding DS routing and instead simply directs the agent to **consult the catalog first**, then follow the pointer. The two become complementary: the skill routes the agent *to* the catalog and still shapes *how* it answers (citations, freshness, fallback), while the catalog authoritatively answers *where* each output lives.

---

## Parallel Track — Deterministic data pipeline & warehouse

**Goal:** serve operational reporting (BI dashboards) and scale DL's machine-retrieval signals, via the **same MCP interface** as everything else.

**This is not a fourth step — it's an independent track.** It shares Levels 1–3's foundations (MCP exposure, SSO, the catalog) but doesn't depend on their *order*: build it whenever the BI use case matters, before or after Level 3. Equally, Levels 1–3 stand on their own without it.

It is a **deterministic path** — no AI in the loop:

```
DSs → Deterministic Pipeline → Warehouse → BI Dashboards
```

- **Deterministic pipelines** handle known, repeatable transforms — dashboard tables, aggregations, metrics, reporting indexes, scheduled extracts — typically materialized in a **warehouse**. They assign each output a sharing group (the same fail-closed model as §2) and register their outputs in the catalog (Level 3), exactly like the DL skill does.
- **The warehouse is exposed via MCP like any other DS.** An agent or app queries it through the same `verified-SSO-token` path; the catalog points to warehouse tables (`store_kind = warehouse`, `bq://dataset.table`) just as it points to a Doc or a Sheet. To consumers, the warehouse is simply one more discoverable store.
- The warehouse is also **one option for DL's machine-retrieval backing store at scale** — the natural promotion target from §2.2 when signal volume is large. It is *one possibility*, not a requirement of the architecture.

*Hardening (inline):* the warehouse is a non-versioned store, so its writers (pipelines and any DL-signal promotion landing here) run under the **governed-writer controls** — no long-lived keys, rotation, least privilege, audit logging. A BigQuery warehouse honors a Google Group via IAM directly; an admin only has to provision a Group for an audience whose source DS isn't already group-based.

Because it's a parallel track, it can be deferred entirely, or pulled forward ahead of Level 3 if reporting is the more urgent need.

## Why this strategy

Each layer is a **falsifiable bet**, and the order is chosen so each one's spend is justified by evidence from the layer before it:

- **Layer 0** establishes whether a bought tool is already good enough, and — win or lose — yields the gap backlog that justifies any build at all. This operationalizes the build-vs-buy open question and the front-loaded falsification experiment from [lik-architecture-concise.md §11](lik-architecture-concise.md): buy first, A/B against the bought baseline, build only the gaps.
- **Level 1** proves SSO-gated MCP access is enough for real work.
- **Level 2** proves precomputed outputs beat fan-out search.
- **Level 3** proves a single transparent catalog beats per-store lookups.
- The **deterministic pipeline** runs as a parallel track, adding reporting whenever BI demands it.

Ship one, learn, then spend on the next — rather than committing to the full system up front.
