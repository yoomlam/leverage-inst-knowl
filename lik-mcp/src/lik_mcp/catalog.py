    extent of the subject (`word_similarity` >= `min_similarity`, which catches typos and
    reordered words). `word_similarity` — not plain `similarity` — is used so a short query
    isn't diluted by a long subject (e.g. "Atals" still matches "Atlas Mapping Service"). The
    substring arm keeps partials that fall below the similarity floor. `category`, when
    given, is an exact-match pre-filter (it is not fuzzy-matched; note that index rows
    currently leave category NULL). An empty/whitespace query is a clean empty result (it
    must not degenerate into a match-all), and `limit` is clamped to a sane range so a
    caller can neither error nor pull an unbounded page. No match is a clean empty result,
    never an error — mirrors lookup/list. Like those, it applies no ACL filtering.

    The gin_trgm_ops index on `subject` accelerates the ILIKE arm; the word_similarity arm
    is computed over the entry_type-filtered subset (narrowed by the composite PK). Fine at
    thousands of rows; if a single entry_type grows much larger, switch to a GiST
