# lik-mcp

The Discovery Layer's service-fronted store: an MCP service in front of a Postgres
database holding the **Catalog** and **Confirmation signals** (v0.4 architecture). The
AI never touches the database directly — it calls a fixed menu of intent-named tools,
and the service does the database work and enforces the rules.

Scope and decisions: [../docs/plans/2026-06-24-01-postgres-mcp-connector-plan.md](../docs/plans/2026-06-24-01-postgres-mcp-connector-plan.md)
and [../docs/brainstorms/2026-06-24-01-catalog-confirmations-mcp-service-requirements.md](../docs/brainstorms/2026-06-24-01-catalog-confirmations-mcp-service-requirements.md).

## Tools

- `register_catalog_entry(entry)` — upsert a Catalog row on `(entry_type, subject)`.
- `lookup_catalog_entry(entry_type, subject)` — one exact-match lookup; a miss is a clean not-found.
- `confirm_source(citation)` — record a confirmation; rejects unresolvable citations, dedupes per user per source-version.
- `read_confirmations(citation)` — accumulated confirmations for one cited source-version.

There is **no** generic query tool by design.

## Set up

Create and activate a virtual environment, then install the package:

```sh
uv venv                        # creates .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Run the test database

```sh
docker compose up -d          # starts postgres:18.4 and applies db/init.sql
```

## Initialize a deployed database

The Docker entrypoint only runs `db/init.sql` for the local test DB. For any other
database, apply the (idempotent) schema once with the same config the service reads:

```sh
python scripts/init_db.py                                  # uses .env / env vars
LIK_DB_HOST=prod-db LIK_DB_SSLMODE=require python scripts/init_db.py
```

It creates schema only — never drops or truncates. Grant the deployed app role
membership in the `*_writer` / `dl_reader` roles per your governed-writer policy.

## Test

```sh
LIK_ENV=test pytest
```

The suite **requires `LIK_ENV=test`** and aborts otherwise — it `TRUNCATE`s the
tables between tests, so it must point at a disposable database, never the deployed
one (which runs `LIK_ENV=prod`). It skips with a hint if no database is reachable.
Point `LIK_DB_*` at a throwaway DB (e.g. the docker compose one).

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit. Swapping the test DB for the real one is a
credentials change here, not a code change. `LIK_ENV=dev|test` uses a stub identity
verifier; any other value fails closed (real Google OIDC is a later slice).

## Not yet built (deferred)

Real Google OIDC verification, the Google-Group → Postgres-role RLS bridge,
governed-writer credential rotation, confirmation backup/retention, rate-limiting
thresholds, and the producer/Query skills. See the plan's scope boundaries.
