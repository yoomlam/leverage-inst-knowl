# lik-mcp

The Discovery Layer's service-fronted store: an MCP service in front of a Postgres
database holding the **Catalog** and **Confirmation signals** (v0.4 architecture). The
AI never touches the database directly — it calls a fixed menu of intent-named tools,
and the service does the database work and enforces the rules.

Scope and decisions: [../docs/plans/2026-06-24-01-postgres-mcp-connector-plan.md](../docs/plans/2026-06-24-01-postgres-mcp-connector-plan.md)
and [../docs/brainstorms/2026-06-24-01-catalog-confirmations-mcp-service-requirements.md](../docs/brainstorms/2026-06-24-01-catalog-confirmations-mcp-service-requirements.md).

## Tools

- `register_catalog_entry(entry)` — upsert a Catalog row on `(entry_type, subject)`.
- `lookup_catalog_entry(entry_type, subject)` — one exact-match lookup; a miss is a clean not-found.
- `list_catalog_entries(entry_type)` — every Catalog row for one `entry_type`, ordered by subject; bounded by the discovery key, not a free-form predicate.
- `confirm_source(citation)` — record a confirmation; rejects unresolvable citations, dedupes per user per source-version.
- `read_confirmations(citation)` — accumulated confirmations for one cited source-version.

There is **no** generic query tool by design.

## Set up

```sh
uv venv                        # creates .venv
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run everything through `uv run` (it uses `.venv` automatically — no activation needed).

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit. `LIK_ENV=local|test` uses a stub identity
verifier; any other value — including cloud `dev`/`prod` — fails closed (real Google OIDC
is a later slice). Swapping databases is a credentials change here, never code.

## Run the test database

```sh
docker compose up -d db       # just Postgres (postgres:18.4, applies db/init.sql)
```

(`docker compose up -d` with no service also starts the MCP server — see "Local
database and server" below. For the test suite you only need `db`.)

## Test

```sh
uv run pytest
```

The suite `TRUNCATE`s the tables, so it **refuses to run unless `LIK_DB_NAME` ends in
`_test`** — a deployed DB like `likdb` can never be hit. It skips if no database is reachable.

## Local database and server (for manual testing)

`docker compose up` starts Postgres **and** the lik-mcp HTTP server, and on the first run
auto-creates a persistent `likdb_local` — separate from the disposable `likdb_test` the suite
`TRUNCATE`s, so your manual-testing data survives:

```sh
docker compose up -d          # Postgres + lik-mcp server on 127.0.0.1:8000
```

The server listens over HTTP (the MCP "streamable-http" transport — a long-lived server you
connect to by URL, rather than one each client launches itself) at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`.
It runs with `LIK_ENV=local` (stub identity — self-asserted, not real trust) and points at
`likdb_local`.
Verify it's up with the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector)
against that URL, or any MCP client.

If your data volume predates this and `likdb_local` is missing, create it once by hand:

```sh
docker compose exec db createdb -U lik likdb_local
LIK_DB_NAME=likdb_local uv run python scripts/init_db.py   # apply schema
```

### Connect the service to your agent

**Claude Desktop** — Desktop's custom connectors **can't reach `localhost`**: it hands the
connector URL to Anthropic's cloud, which opens the connection from its own servers, so a
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp` connector silently fails. Use the `mcp-remote` stdio→HTTP bridge in
`claude_desktop_config.json` instead (Settings → Developer → Edit Config; on macOS it's
`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lik-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

This needs Node/`npx`. Restart Claude Desktop to load it. (Do **not** add the raw URL as a
custom connector — that's the path that can't reach localhost.)

**Claude CLI** — the CLI connects from your machine, so the URL works directly:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http lik-mcp http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp
```

**No-Docker alternative (stdio)** — skip the container and let the client spawn the server over
stdio, pinned to `likdb_local` (run from the `lik-mcp` folder):

```sh
claude mcp add lik-mcp -- \
  env LIK_ENV=local LIK_DB_NAME=likdb_local uv run python -m lik_mcp
```

The skills also call the Atlassian (Confluence) MCP tools, so connect that server too. The
lik-mcp tools (`register_catalog_entry`, `lookup_catalog_entry`, `list_catalog_entries`,
`confirm_source`, `read_confirmations`) should now show up in the agent.

### Populate the Catalog

The Catalog starts empty. Run the **`sync-catalog-from-project-indexes`** skill — it crawls
every Confluence page tagged `project-index` and upserts one Catalog row per page via
`register_catalog_entry`. It's idempotent, so re-running just updates rows in place. It writes
to whatever DB lik-mcp points at, so confirm the server is on `likdb_local` (not `likdb_test`)
first. Expect a summary like `Synced N project-index pages … X inserted, Y updated`.

### Query the Catalog

With rows in place, run the **`query-project-index`** skill and pass a project question (e.g.
*"what has Nava done with Medicaid?"*). It escalates through exact lookup → list-and-scan →
bounded Confluence search, **asking before it widens scope** at each step, then ranks the cited
pages by their confirmation signals (`read_confirmations`) and offers to record your own
(`confirm_source`). Because `LIK_ENV=local` uses the stub verifier, confirmations are attributed
to whatever email you pass as the token — fine for testing, not real trust.

## Initialize a deployed database

The Docker entrypoint only initializes the local `likdb_test` and `likdb_local` databases.
For any other database, apply the (idempotent) schema with the service's own config:

```sh
uv run python scripts/init_db.py                           # uses .env / env vars
LIK_DB_HOST=prod-db LIK_DB_SSLMODE=require uv run python scripts/init_db.py
```

Schema only — never drops or truncates. Grant the app role membership in the
`*_writer` / `dl_reader` roles per your governed-writer policy.

## TODO

A local/test harness with throwaway data, not a production service. Until real serving
(verified identities, enforced access) lands:

**Current limits (do not treat these as done):**

- **Prod is inert.** With `LIK_ENV=prod` the fail-closed verifier rejects *every*
  tool call. The service runs but answers nobody until real OIDC lands.
- **Identity is not verified.** In `local`/`test` the stub treats the token as the
  caller's email, so `confirmed_by` / `updated_by` are effectively self-asserted.
  Confirmations accumulated this way are not real trust.
- **No access control.** There is no Group → Postgres-role RLS yet; reads return
  rows with **no `access_groups` filtering**. Do **not** load real or restricted
  data into any instance.
- **Citations aren't really resolved.** `ShapeResolver` only checks well-formedness
  and a known `store_kind` — it does not confirm the cited source exists/reaches.
- **No governed-writer security or durability.** Keyless/rotated credentials, audit
  logging, and confirmation backup/retention are unbuilt.

**Deferred work that lifts the limits (see the plan's scope boundaries):**

- Real Google OIDC token verification (replaces the stub verifier).
- Google-Group → Postgres-role RLS bridge (enforces `access_groups` on reads).
- Real per-store citation resolution (behind the existing `CitationResolver` seam).
- Governed-writer controls: keyless/rotated credentials, least privilege, audit logging.
- Confirmation backup/retention, plus rate-limiting / minimum-distinct-confirmer thresholds.
- The producer (DL-creation) and Query skills that call this service.
